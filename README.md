# Recommendations_with_IBM

In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this. 

This is a recommendation system project to enhance the user experience and connect them with assets to improve user engagement. This personalizes the experience for each user. Interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform are analyzed and new article recommendations are made to them which they will probably like.

The jupyter notebook has the following contents:
1. Data Exploration
